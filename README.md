praxislaf
=========

The praxis look and feel.

Based on the praxis code available https://code.google.com/p/praxis/source/browse .

I mavenized the code, separated the icons in the resources package. To use in conjuncion with netbeans, compile, 
put the jar somewhere, and execute netbeans with the following commandline:


netbeans -cp:p &lt;path to your praxis jar&gt; --laf PraxisLookAndFeel

Here's a screenshot with netbeans 7.4 running praxislaf, with Monster2 theme:
